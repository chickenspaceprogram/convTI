convTI
--------
A command line utility for converting .txt and .csv files into the format used by certain Texas Instruments calculators.
--------
Version 0.1.x (alpha)
--------
Dependencies:

Java Development Kit (JDK)
 - version 22 was used to create this application, earlier or later versions will likely work as well
--------
This application is still incomplete, as is its documentation.
Please raise an issue on GitHub if you encounter any issues or bugs! 
Also, feel free to suggest features/additions.

If you want an *actually good* version of this, check out SourceCoder 3!
This project is more for fun and teaching myself Java than for practical use, if I'm honest.
